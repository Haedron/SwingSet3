There are two mechanisms for telling SwingSet3 which classes are &quot;demos&quot;: </li></ol><blockquote>  <ul>    <li>Create a &quot;demolist&quot; file in your demo jar's META-INF directory; this file should contain an ordered list of your demo class names. If you're creating a new demo within the <code>com.sun.swingset3.demos</code> package, then add that class name to the existing <code>META-INF/demolist</code> file in the project directory</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>Supply the name of a text file containing the demo class names as a command line argument.</li>  </ul>  <blockquote>    <p> <code>java -cp mydemo.jar -jar swingset3.jar  &lt;mydemos.txt&gt;</code></p>    <p> where <code>&lt;mydemos.txt&gt;</code> is a file containing an ordered list of class name(s) for your demo(s).</p>  </blockquote></blockquote><h4><a name="level2" id="level2"></a>Ensure Valid  Demo Property Values</h4><p>While a demo can run in SwingSet3 without a specified category, icon, description, or source file array, the user experience will be improved if these properties exist. SwingSet3 uses an annotation to support specifying these on a demo class:</p><ol>  <li>    <p> Make sure the demo class <strong>name</strong> provides the user with clue as to what the demo does.</p>  </li>  <li> Put the following <strong>annotation</strong> at the top of your demo class file:    <pre>import swingset3.DemoProperties;@DemoProperties(    value = &quot;My 2D Demo&quot;, // demo name    category = &quot;Cool Stuff&quot;,    description = &quot;Demonstrates how Java2D can make your head spin.&quot;)public class My2DDemo extends JPanel...</pre>    <p><br>      <em>Note: Need to modify this to support localization of user-readible properties</em><br>    </p>  </li>  <li>Create a nice 32x32 icon image for your demo, naming it the same name as the demo class. example: <code>./resources/images/JXPanelDemo.png</code></li></ol><p>If the annotation doesn't exist, SwingSet3 will synthesize the demo's property values: </p><table width="98%"  border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">  <tr>    <td><strong>Property </strong></td>    <td><strong>Type</strong></td>    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>    <td><strong>Default Value </strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>name</td>    <td>String</td>    <td>name of demo as displayed to user</td>    <td>uses demo class name, removing any trailing &quot;Demo&quot; string if it exists; <span class="style1">e.g. JButtonDemo is named &quot;JButton&quot;</span></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>category</td>    <td>String</td>    <td>category used to group demo inside demo selection tree</td>    <td>uses the demo class's package name or &quot;general&quot; if no package name exists; <span class="style6">e.g. controls.JButtonDemo would have category: &quot;controls&quot; </span></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>icon</td>    <td>Icon</td>    <td>icon displayed to user for demo</td>    <td>looks for file in ./resources/images that matches the class name but has a &quot;.jpg&quot;, &quot;.gif&quot;, or &quot;.png&quot; extension, if none found, displays no demo icon; <span class="style1">e.g. ./resources/images/JButtonDemo.gif</span></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>shortDescription</td>    <td>String</td>    <td>one line describing demo's purpose </td>    <td>will display generic description </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>descriptionURL</td>    <td>URL</td>    <td>url for HTML file which describes  demo </td>    <td>looks for file in ./resources that matches the class name with &quot;.html&quot; extension, if none found then does not display html description (only instantiates demo class); <span class="style1">e.g. ./resources/JButtonDemo.html </span></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>sourceFiles</td>    <td>URL[] </td>    <td>provides url to each source file</td>    <td>array of length 1 with url to demo class name source file; note this does require the source file to be copied to the classes/sources directory (using simple ant task)</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp; </p><h4><a name="level3" id="level3"></a>Provide Source Code for Demo Files</h4><p>The source code display (and fragment highlighting) are a key SwingSet3 feature, so you'll want to ensure SwingSet3 can find the source files for your demo:</p><ol>  <li> If the demo consists of<em> a single source file </em>, then SwingSet3 will automatically calculate the path to the source file based on the package and class name.  However, if your demo consists of more than one file, then put the source file list in the <strong>annotation</strong>:    <ol>      <blockquote>        <pre>@DemoProperties(    value = &quot;My 2D Demo&quot;,     category = &quot;Cool Stuff&quot;,    description = &quot;Demonstrates how Java2D can make your head spin.&quot;    sourceFiles = {       &quot;sources/mydemo/My2DDemo.java&quot;,       &quot;sources/mydemo/GraphicUtilties.java&quot;    } ) public class My2DDemo extends JPanel {</pre>      </blockquote>    </ol>  </li>  <li>If you are creating a demo outside of the swingset3.dev.java.net project, make sure the source files exist in your demo's jar file in the classes/sources directory; e.g. classes/sources/containers/JXPanelDemo.java<br />    the following ant task can be used to make this automatic:</li></ol><ol>  <blockquote>    <pre><code>&lt;target name=&quot;-post-compile&quot;&gt;  &lt;delete dir=&quot;${build.classes.dir}/sources&quot; /&gt;   &lt;copy todir=&quot;${build.classes.dir}/sources&quot; verbose=&quot;true&quot; overwrite=&quot;true&quot; includeEmptyDirs=&quot;false&quot;&gt;    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${src.dir}&quot;&gt;      &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot; /&gt;    &lt;/fileset&gt;  &lt;/copy&gt;&lt;/target&gt;</code></pre>  </blockquote></ol><h4><a name="level4" id="level4"></a>Support Source Code Fragment Highlighting (Snippets)</h4><p>SwingSet3's source code &quot;snippet&quot; highlighting makes it easy for developers to view specific code fragments associated with specific features within a demo. Each such feature is described by a 'key', which is a simple text description of what the feature does. Supporting this simply requires adding the required snippet tags to comments within your source code. </p><p> The text following immediately after the snippet start tag (<code>&lt;snip&gt;</code>) will be used as the key for that snippet. <br />Multiple snippets may share the same key, defining a &quot;snippet set&quot; for a particular feature. Snippet sets may even span across multiple source files. The key for each snippet set is displayed in a combobox to allow the user to select which snippet set should be highlighted. For example:&lt;p&gt;</p><blockquote>  <pre> <code>    //<span class="style4">&lt;snip&gt;</span><span class="style3">Create dog array</span>     ArrayList dogs = new ArrayList();     //<span class="style4">&lt;/snip&gt;</span>          [other code...maybe even in another source file]          //<span class="style4">&lt;snip&gt;</span><span class="style3">Create dog array</span>     dogs.add(&quot;Labrador&quot;);     dogs.add(&quot;Golden Retriever&quot;);     dogs.add(&quot;Australian Shepherd&quot;);     //<span class="style4">&lt;/snip&gt;</span></code></pre></blockquote><p>The above code would create a snippet set containing 2 snippets with the key &quot;Create dog array&quot;. This key would be displayed in the combobox in SwingSet3's source code display panel and when the user selects it, those snippets will become highlighted and can be navigated using buttons or accelerator keys.</p><p><em>Note: we're considering changing the &quot;&lt;snip&gt;&quot; markers to something simpler to type</em></p><h4><br />   <a name="level5" id="level5"></a>Supply HTML Description File </h4> <p>If you'd like to provide a nice HTML description of your demo (with associated links to docs, etc) and have that nicely placed to the left of your running demo in the demo pane (as you see for FrameDemo, ButtonDemo, etc):</p> <ol>   <li> provide an html file with the same name as your demo class; e.g. <code>./resources/JXPanelDemo.html</code></li> </ol> <p><em>Note: SwingSet3 does it's best to balance the panel's real estate between the html and the demo, but it's wise to keep the HTML short and sweet.</em></p> <p> If no such html file exists, then the demo class will fill the entire demo pane.</p> <h4><a name="level6" id="level6"></a>Enable Direct Component Snippet Highlighting</h4> <p>In SwingSet3 it's possible to enable a popup menu on components within your demo so that the user can go directly to the code associated with creating that particular component.</p><p> All that is required is to add a client property to that specific component in your demo that maps it to the snippet key (as described in <a href="#level4">Support Source Code Fragment Highlighting</a>). Note that this client property must be a case-sensitive match to the snippet key.</p><blockquote>  <p> e.g. The following source will cause a popup menu to be created on the &quot;Go&quot; button, which when activated will automatically highlight the snippets associated with creating that button:</p>  <pre> <code>//&lt;snip&gt;<span class="style3">Create button with background color</span> button = new JButton(&quot;Go&quot;); button.setBackground(Color.green); button.setContentAreaFilled(true); button.setOpaque(false); button.setToolTipText(&quot;button with background color&quot;); //&lt;/snip&gt;</code></pre>  <pre><code> // ENABLE POPUP!  <strong>button.putClientProperty(&quot;snippetKey&quot;, &quot;<span class="style3">Create button with background color</span>&quot;);</strong> </code></pre></blockquote><h4><a name="level7" id="level7"></a>Implement start() and stop()</h4><p>SwingSet3 will cache demo instances, however there is only ever one &quot;current&quot; demo visible to the user at a time. If your demo needs to detect when it is being paused and restarted as a result of the user switching between &quot;current&quot; demos, then you may implement the following methods:</p><blockquote>  <pre><code>public void start()</code></pre>  <pre><code>public void stop()</code></pre></blockquote><p>Note that SwingSet3 uses reflection to determine whether to invoke these methods, so they are completely optional. They are recommended if your demo does any sort of processing that you don't want executing while your demo is suspended (animation timers, etc). </p><h4><a name="lookandfeel" id="lookandfeel"></a>Adding New Look and Feels</h4><p>SwingSet3 supports Look and Feel switching. It uses <code>UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels()</code> to determine the base set of look and feels, however it also uses the Java6 ServiceLoader mechanism to find auxilary look and feels that might be specified in additional jar files. To add a look and feel, create a <code>META-INF/services/javax.swing.LookAndFeel</code> file in your jar manifest that contains the name(s) of your LookAndFeel classes.</p><p><em>Note: Swing really needs to fix UIManager to do the service loader lookup in the toolkit itself</em></p></body></html>

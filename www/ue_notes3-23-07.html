(?) (how about on Mac?) </li>  <li> Need to add Help and AboutBox to menubar.</li>  <li> Add link to NetBeans somewhere. (in demo placeholder image ?)</li>  <li> If possible, do not sign webstarted demo to avoid turning off untrusting users.</li></ul><p>Demo Selector Tree</p><ul>  <li> Single-click on demos in demo-selector-tree should run them! (current double-click behavior is very confusing)</li>  <li> Remove the led icons on running demos in the demo-selector-tree; instead, indicate that a demo has been run by changing the font color on the demo name (a la browser link style)</li>  <li> Downplay the &quot;tree&quot; aspect of the demo-selector-tree; remove all lines (on Windows) and only display simple open/close arrows on category nodes. </li>  <li> Allow selector tree view to be changed:<br />    - view by category (current)<br />    - sort alphabetically</li></ul><p>Running Demo Pane</p><ul>  <li> Eliminate running-demos tabbedpane - simply display the currently running demo in the right panel.</li>  <li> Add running demo's name as title to running-demo-pane.</li>  <li> Display progress animation in demo-pane (and/or tree node?) while demo loads</li>  <li> Need nice placeholder image (animation??) while no demo is running</li>  <li> Possibly add more direct connection from demo-pane to snippets in source-code-pane; maybe a list of links in html? maybe an icon with a popup that lists the snippeted features?</li></ul><p>Source Code Pane</p><ul>  <li> Splitpane should be fully adjustable (not limited to height of tree/demo pane)</li>  <li> When source-code-pane is hidden, just make the source disappear, leaving the close (open) button and<br />    splitpane divider there.</li>  <li> Source-code-pane should have a title: e.g. &quot;Source Code for JButton Demo&quot;...</li>  <li> Font for source-code-pane should be larger by default and should be a configurable preference<br />    (control&quot;+&quot; /control&quot;-&quot; could be an accelerator to automatically change the font size)</li>  <li> Snippet combobox should be one consistent width and should not change size based on available snippets. (currently it's too long)</li>  <li> Snippet combobox label should be: &quot;Highlight code for &quot;</li>  <li> Snippet combobox should replace &quot;None&quot; with &quot; &lt;select one&gt;&quot;</li>  <li> The snippet navigation buttons should be moved inside source pane and not displayed on same line as snippet combobox; a control which allows next/previous snippet navigation, as well as displays indicator of current snippet position within the series should be placed inside the tab's content area (just below tab?).</li>  <li> Snippet highlight color should be preference</li>  <li> Need to be able to also select highlighted snippet code (bug!)</li></ul></body></html>
